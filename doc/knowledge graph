we divide knowledge as "common knowledge" and "specialized knowledge".
common knowledge can be represented by an infinite knowledge graph and a common knowledge process module.
every aspect specialized knowledge needs "expert module".

partner can master common knowledge, every expert module is a black box to partner.
partner knows when to ask expert module question and get answer.
question and answer are all represented by one knowledge-node.

partner should have as much as knowledge in "common knowledge".
expert module should only for things which are beyond "infinite knowledge graph" module.


property is metadata data of knowledge, not knowledge itself.

node and relation should both have and only have the follow property:
1. appear time: when this node appears in the world
2. disappear time:
3. confidence:

node/relation that has no appear time and disappear time is the same as it does not exist.
